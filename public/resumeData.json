    "bio":"I'm a data scientist with a product mindset, passionate about building scalable AI/ML solutions that unlock insights and drive impact. Currently at Warner Bros. Discovery, I lead the development of machine learning models and data platforms that power customer experience analytics across global streaming brands. I enjoy working at the intersection of data engineering, modeling, and product strategy - translating messy real-world problems into clean, efficient systems.\n\nMy toolkit includes Python, PyTorch, SQL, Airflow, AWS, Databricks, and Snowflake, and I'm especially comfortable working with LLMs, clustering & classification algorithms, and streamlining complex pipelines. I love designing intuitive tools that make data accessible to everyone, from analysts to executives. \n\nCurious by nature and collaborative by default, I thrive in fast-paced environments where I can work cross-functionally, mentor others, and continuously learn. Whether it's scaling up a data platform or experimenting with a new model architecture, I'm always looking for ways to make data more actionable and impactful.",
