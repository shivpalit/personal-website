# Shiv's Personal Website

Welcome to my personal website repository! As a data scientist and product manager who dabbles in front-end development as a hobby, I built this site using React to showcase my professional experience and projects. While I primarily work with data and ML/AI in my day job, I enjoy exploring web development in my spare time.

## Tech Stack
- **React**: Built using React for a responsive and interactive user experience
- **Docker**: Containerized for consistent development and deployment environments
- **CSS/HTML**: Custom styling and responsive design
- **React Components**: Modular components for portfolio, resume, and contact sections

## Running the Application

### Development
```bash
# Run development server with hot-reload
docker-compose up personal-website-dev
```
The development server will run on `http://localhost:3000` with hot-reload enabled for real-time updates while coding.

### Production
```bash
# Run production build
docker-compose up personal-website
```
The production build will be served on `http://localhost:80` using a lightweight Nginx server.

## About This Project
This website serves as both my professional portfolio and a learning project for front-end development. While I'm not a front-end developer by trade (I spend most of my time with Python, ML models, and data pipelines!), I believe in the value of understanding different aspects of software development. This project has been a fun way to keep my React skills sharp while maintaining a professional web presence.

Feel free to explore the code, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions!
